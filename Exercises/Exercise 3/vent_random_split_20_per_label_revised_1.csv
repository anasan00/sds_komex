I wish I could turn back the time and be wiser.,0
"i want to help people, i want to do good, i want to be a good friend but sometimes, i cannot carry the weight of other people's problems when i am collapsing underneath my own because i have feelings and my own demons as well ",0
Went bra shopping yesterday and now I feel really sad. I can't find my size anymore in primary because I'm to big. Mum says it's what all the girls want but I really don't. ,0
I just feel so alone and I’m not sure why or how to fix it. -💋,0
I feel sad because my sis dnt want to take me with to her feature mom,0
Why am I crying over exams again ,0
I want some friends in my new area but I have no idea how to make friends!,0
"""Now that you love her everything has changed""...I loved her when we were still best friends. What changed is that you were jealo0us enough t0o think that we will change. I didnt change with you. And unkess you make me, i never will",0
I tried not to care today and I almost didn't,0
In a really dark place right now...,0
I'm not really okay but I don't know why ,0
"I'm just gonna stop looking for my ""one"" and just play video games. Its useless",0
my life is nothing. ,0
Great now my head hurts too,0
okay go ahead and ignore me,0
I just wish I could tell my mom these things,0
I get that hes busy. I dont blame him for ignoring me. There are things much more important than me. Im glad hes taking care of himself first. Im not the only mentally ill one i know how tired he is. I understand and thats what makes it so much worse that i still want him to love me.,0
I flinch when I see lightning. ,0
Don't lose sight of your goals.,1
"I want you to do me a favor tonight. When you're outside, look up at the sky. See the stars and the moon. Take it all in, and realize that in the entire universe, with every possibility, every challenge, you are still here. That has to count for something. Just think about it. Any planet, with infinite possibilities of life, and you ended up here. You're made up of the very elements forged from stars, all coming together to make you who you are. Every rock and piece of debris pushed everything into perfect place, just so you could be here, so you could have room to move and live in. When you were born, it wasn't just you floating along at your own leisurely pace. You competed with millions upon millions of other cells, all fighting to do what you accomplished. You've made it through every setback, every sickness, every problem and battle and struggle. I will always bet on you making it, because I know you can. You've made it through 100% of everything life has thrown at you, so I know that you can make it through anything that comes your way, and those are odds I'm willing to bet on",1

"My boyfriend <3 <3 <3 <3 I can't wait to see him again, oh my gosh. I won't say today was perfect, but I had a really good time with him. I really didn't want him to leave. And I probably won't see him for at least a week.... He has exams next week, so he needs to study and he has reports to write. I should take this time to refocus myself as well. ",1
"Guys, I just want you to remember that your worth is not determined by your failures or your success 💕",1
"there are so many questions i have honestlywhat is the counterargument to the ""communism works _in theory_ because human nature"" rherotic other than ""capitalism is worse"" ? how are we sure wed be able to enforce something like that ? would it have to be totalitarian ?im not as smart as i wish i was",1
"Love is blind, so let's have a love so deep that even a blindman could see it. So who's interested 😜",1
Urgh when I fall for people I always get so lovey-dovey and cuddly. It is both my strengh and weakness,1
"I wonder what having a relationship is like, can't wait to experience it with someone that I can see having s potential future with, just the thought of it excites me ",1
I'm just remembering that I texted 🤓 on Thanksgiving and told him how grateful I was to have him and he told me that nobody ever says those things to him and that was the day I promised myself I would always tell him how important he is,1

I HATE THEM SO MUCH Thank god this is the last time i'll see them,4
Woke up at 4am...still cannot fall asleep and I have a horrid headache...grrr,4
When people ask me why I don't have v much money and it's mostly gone a few days after pay day is getting real old. You try supporting two people on a $500 paycheck with a shit ton of bills and getting paid bi-weekly. I go days without eating and it sucks but you gotta do what you gotta do. I can't get a second job cause working 40 hours a week already kills me and I only get 1-4 hours of sleep every night. If I got another job it'd kill me.,4
Like what are you talking about! You were the one who suggested it in the first place. Don't be surprised when I'm upset. And idea why I'm upset cause you always do this.,4
