This weekend is stressing me out. I have to be up early every morning and I'll be in a hotel room with 5 other people. I feel like I'm going to annoy them cuz I don't know most of them very well. My friend keeps inviting people and I told her I didn't want to go but she says it'll be fun. Can we just fast forward to Sunday pls 😁,2

You get upset when your phone doesn't work and we can't be together and when our time gets cut off because it's one of the most precious things in the world to you. #noonelikeyou,1

"I want you to do me a favor tonight. When you're outside, look up at the sky. See the stars and the moon. Take it all in, and realize that in the entire universe, with every possibility, every challenge, you are still here. That has to count for something. Just think about it. Any planet, with infinite possibilities of life, and you ended up here. You're made up of the very elements forged from stars, all coming together to make you who you are. Every rock and piece of debris pushed everything into perfect place, just so you could be here, so you could have room to move and live in. When you were born, it wasn't just you floating along at your own leisurely pace. You competed with millions upon millions of other cells, all fighting to do what you accomplished. You've made it through every setback, every sickness, every problem and battle and struggle. I will always bet on you making it, because I know you can. You've made it through 100% of everything life has thrown at you, so I know that you can make it through anything that comes your way, and those are odds I'm willing to bet on",1

I get that hes busy. I dont blame him for ignoring me. There are things much more important than me. Im glad hes taking care of himself first. Im not the only mentally ill one i know how tired he is. I understand and thats what makes it so much worse that i still want him to love me.,0
