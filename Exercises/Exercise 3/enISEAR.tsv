1021	Joy	I felt ... when I was a young child in 1980 at the age of of just ten.

Every day I'd come back from school desperately hoping it had arrived to another day of disappointment. When it finally arrived after lots of delays I felt a huge amount of intense ... and also excitement, it was one of the best warm feelings as an autistic child I could have felt, it was like all my Christmas's had come together in one, I couldn't wait to get it connected and only my parents forcing me to go to bed later that night forced me away from it or I would have stayed up all night and the ... of receiving it remained for a long time, this remained an obsession that never ended. It's probably difficult to understand how much ... I felt to receive such a basic computer by someone who doesn't have an addictive autistic interest like I did and still have, but I haven't stopped using computers every day since then and I'm now 49 years old.
