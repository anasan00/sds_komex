My partner caught it, and luckily I did not; I assume it is because as soon as he felt ill he immediately masked in the house and took a Covid test, isolating himself for two days before he tested positive. While he was positive, he remained isolated with food and beverages brought to his door and left on the table outside the room. He masked when opening the door and shut the door as quickly as possible. After he broke his fever, he came into common areas masked *only when necessary*, washed his hands before and after touching anything, and Lysol’d everything he touched, even with clean hands. I masked in common areas and isolated in a different room. Common areas were only occupied by either of us *separately* while we had to utilize those spaces for mandatory requirements (food, bathroom, etc). He remained isolated for ten days, three of which he tested negative each day. I constantly washed my hands if I had to go into common areas, and the door was shut at all times to the room I isolated in as well.

At some point, around a month after testing positive, I tried to drink a beer. I got half way, and felt like I was dying from alcohol poisoning.\n",

      "I'm getting fuckers who reply back to me that the shots were ineffective since I got long covid and taking that as justification that the shots dont do anything.

We know it can cause brain issues.\n",

China is playing the long game to keep it's labor force functional over the long term.  We're playing the short game to keep the economy moving now.  There's a lot of things I don't like about China, and I know that approach would never work here, but I honestly think there's good reason for what they're doing and it will pay off for them.\n",
